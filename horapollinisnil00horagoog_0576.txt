The ΑἱρΙιαόει.

For the careful reviewer ol the two accompanying platena lew
explanatory remarks will suffice to fix the nature and origin of the
alphabet, and to justily the identificatioa ol the characters with the
corresponding Chaldee letters.

l. Our alphabet ol consonante stands nearest, among the several Sy·
riae alphabeta, not to the common Nestorian, hut to the Palmyrena
character. When we look over the table 5, in Geseniua' Monumenta
Phoenieiae, we shall soon observe the strong likenese between the two
series of signs. Geeeuiua has often placed, side by side, three ond
more figures ol thereme sound3 those which, under each letter, he
places laet, agree iu general exactly with our chaldea*

2. The characters peculiar to our alphahet are not, however,
entirely new. The Daleth and Resh have almost the Phoenician

form, and are like each other, aa they are almost in all Semitic
alphabets; this circumstance ie a strong evidence in favour ol
our interpretation. The curicus large Nun is somewhat less different
from the Palmyrena than from the Phoenician 3 the upper horizontal
line is wanting in both. 1 have therefore doubted, whether it could
not be a Peh, which it resembles in the Palmyrene table. But this
supposition lecim to words which cannot be Semitic. Indeed, our
sign is proved to be Nun, hy Maccabee coins in the British Museum.†

Another proof is the Mendaean lormss of Nun; the lower ex·

tremity a little rounded off makes it almost the same character, re·

’ Compare in particular the third Beth, tire second Gimel, the third Veu, the
first and second Zajin, the third Khet, the first, third, and fourth J od, the third
Kaph‚ the third Lamed, the third and cah Mem, the first Samekh, the second
and third 'Ajim the second Sede, the second and third Kop, the filth Shin, the
moad 'l'hau

† Geren. Mon. Phorn. Tala 3. does not give all the forms os the Maccahee
letters. Ι have seen aooin in the British Muscam, where the name ol Simeon
(Bm-Kartha, probably) was written witha Nun ol thia lind (Thia coin repre-
sents, on the other side, a temple over which a star ic placed.)
