The Natioa ιο which tle Writinp anal tlte Lawpuaqe os the Inscrip-
tion belong.

As the country from the soil of which the jar andito lesden sheet
have been dog ont, is and was inhabitcd not only by Aramaeon tribes,
bnt also by Arabs, particularly in the lower regions down ιο the Persian
gall, an Inscription, found at Abushadhr, may as well bc supposed to
have issued from an Arabio family as from aBabylonian one.

Indced, all Syriae alphabets which are known till now, are not
sufficient ιο explain cur Inscription. Several of its characters mani·
iestly resemble more the Sineitie and oven the Arabio characters,
than any other. The very first letter is an Arabio ajin: the Hc and
Van represent only the Arabio form.

This, and the contenta likcwise, might seem to make it probable,
that we have before us an Arabio Inscription oi a period when dia-
critic signs were not yet used. Alco the proper names, and tho con·
tenta of the last lines, seemed ιο favour this opinion.

still, there are more decisivo reasons for calling the alphabet an
Aramaean one.

First of all, the greater part ol the characters, known to us from
Semitic alphabeta, are old Syriae letters: and most of the new signs of
onr Inscription, stand at least neerer ιο the earlier Aramaean writing‚
than to the Onfio.

In the second place, a character which occurs almost in every linc,
at least once, the small triangle, must be Aleph, denoting, particu-
lerly in the middle and at the end of words, the long vowel A. But
only the Syriae and chaldea no other Semitic languagc, not even
Arabio, uses this Aleph so frequently ss ιο explain its oocurring
twenty-three times in twenty lines of solew letters. And, indeed, the
two clear numerals in the eighth and ninth line, which already ΜΓ.
Norris hod read as diemde and cette, bear manifestly as termina·
tion the same Aleph and A, which they heve only in the Aramaean
dialects.

Finelly, I have discovered an other vowel-mark attached to the

leitextrcmity os various consonants: a little hook, cr acute angle

open below, which must be the sign ol long 1. This sign l find in the
