numeral at the beginning ol the ninthline, which 1 read talita, because
the simple mmcd ia found without thnt hook (sec linat and sixteenth
line). Now, this numeral, if the Inscription were Arabio, would be
tela‘t (which means uetita), corresponding with the Hebrew ahaloth.

It is only in the Syrico dialect that citra is found together with
teldtn.

All thia leads to the conclusion, that the writing and the langunge
ol the Inscription are Chaldee. We hareconne to this result in-
dependently of tha account of Colonel Rawlineon, who calle the
ruina Chaldean3 and thia gives to onr Inscription aquito peculiar
importunae. Hitherto, not a line has been known of native Babylonian
or Chaldee writing in Semitio characters, and for the Chaldee os Em
and the Targume, even the nume of Babylonian or Chaldea hae
beon given np by scholare.

Now, whatever correctione later discoveries may supply to our
interpretation, the fact will appear as certain, from what we have to

etate, that the langnage of Earn. and the Targnme or the
so-called Ohaldee, wan tho languagc of the southern
neighbourhood of Babel, for the Inscription oi Abushadhr oan
only be explained aa chaldea.

The inquiry into the alphabet iteeli will lead ιιι to another irn-

portant conclusion aa to the history oi Semitic writing in general,
and of the Hebrew square characterio particular.
