The contente give only a very slight clue for guessing the ege.

The nome Az-btlat, as we have already shown, is a composition
connected with the worship of Bualtis. Now, Arabia became ac·
quainted with Christianity at the end of the second century (Basra,

which is only st a dey's journey from Abushedhr, was the seat of a
bishop); Mesopotamia, the land of Abgarus, already before the
middle of the second century. Now, aname, which so pointedly
implies preise and service to the heathen goddess Baultis would not
have been given by a Christian father. We may, therefore, say, if
the Inscription does not belong ιο the time before Christ, it must be
attributed ιο one ol the first post-Christian centuries, when the lande
round the Euphrates were still heathen.

The history os the Semitic alphabets, on the other hand, seems not
to allow us to go beck very fer into heathen antiquity.

The Semitio writing on the weights of the palace of Tiglath
Pileser '⁸ is of strictly Phoenicien character: many closed heads, both
round and angular; the letters unequel, unoonneoted‚ and awkward.
From this character, our Inscription differs considerably. It is
more developed‚ more symmetrioel and rounded off ς the heads are
mostly opeued, andin consequence, the characters shortened above:
finally, the cher-sotere are frequently connected. In short, we heve
a cursive or running hand, later than the capitale of the Phoenician.

Now, this cursive characteris most resembling that of the Palmy·
rene Inscriptions. As these extend from the year 49 to 250 of our
era, and as those among their characters, which are ntoat rounded
off, are most resembling ours (see ΠΙ. Νο. 1.), our Inscription might
seem to belong rather to a younger than ιο an earlier period than
the older Palmyrene.

But we meet else with some letters which bear a character anterior
to the Palmyrene, having a more closed, compaot shape. The absence
of flnul letters also bespeaks a high antiquity. A running hand might
