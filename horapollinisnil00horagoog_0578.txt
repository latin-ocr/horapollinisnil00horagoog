the end os the line must not necessarily eoineide with the end of o
word

6. Resemtlozq ohsrsoters ore Beth end Ceph, Doleth ond Resh,
Mem, Koph, end Thau, ond sometimes Lamed and Snmehh. There-
sore, o variety of interpretation moy orise from reading in o
certain osse the one or the other. The following differenoes form the
rule. The Beth hes shsrp oorners, Caph round ones.-Dnleth hss
o lorge ond brosd head ond n short vertioelÍ¾ the head of Resh is
more round end small. I believe the second sign of tho fifth line to
be n Daleth with on ongulsr head, as it is in the Phoenioion period.-
The distinotive feature in Mem is the short flat bosis on which its
right ventionl seems to rest-Finolly, the Samehh of the nixth ond
seventh line has s stronger inward curveturo than the Lomed of the
eleventh ond thirteenth.

7. Most oi the characters show o striking symmetm both in the
sizo of tho consonante within tho line, ond in the signs exoeeding
lt upwerds or downwsrds. The former taho evidently the space of
aequare, like tho characters ol our Hebrew manuscripts.

We moy advert, ot this stege oi our inquiry already, to the snoient
tradition, thot the square ohorooters of tho Hebrow alphabet ere of
Babyloninn origin.

In the ioregoing remarks we hove confined ourselves to such oon-

elusions, in fixing the volus of eooh ohsrooter, os the comparison
with other Semitio alphabeto seemed naturally to leod us to. Any
. preconoeived notions os to the probohle contento of the Inscription
would hove led us ostray. Now, this lsborious tssk being sulfilled,
we may try whether or not the Inscription so resd will give us
words end good sense.
