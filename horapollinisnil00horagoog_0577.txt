our Nun follows the same peculiar rule of taking the vowel Δ, as will
be seen in the second, third, twelfth, fourteeuth and sixteenth linc

There romain two doubtful characters: the He, more Arabio than
Syriae, and the dotted Ajin, which aa eound corresponds with the
Hebrew Ssade, aud aa sign represents the older form of the ajin, es
on the stone of Carpentras.

3. Long vowels (not the short once) are expreseed in writing hy

to the most of emmeramme· Here we discover an analogyr
not so much with the Ethiopian-which uses for denoting the
vowels, besides ite hooks end lines, aleo the ehortening and 111
lengtheuing of the consonant· sign-butwith the Zabean or Mendesu
alphabet, which marks the vowele by' signe occurring aleo 1111911111
semivowels In thie Zabean or Mendacan alphabet aleo, as in 11111 11
Abushadhr, these semivowels are joined on only ιο the aad of 111
consonant, whilat the AEthiopian often Joine them on at 1111ιεί11111

connected lettere may belong sometimes to different words, 1111111

⁸ This rule seems to have been applied very rarely for the Van. in 111· 1¹¹·
scription we find this semivowel suffixed only to ajin.

† This ra the only analogy of our charactere with the Zabeaa or Messdffl
alphabet: for the letter Aleph which' rs quite the same in both, can bededucetl
